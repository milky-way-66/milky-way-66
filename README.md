There are three things about me: <br>
- First, I easily get bored with repetitive things, therefore I always find new challenges and conquer them.
- Second, I am a person who is thirsty for knowledge. I can study anytime, anywhere, in any condition.
- And the last is I have a magic that can connect people.

Currently, I am learning AWS, and working on an SSI project.
