There are three things about me: <br>
First, I easily get bored with repetitive things, therefore I always find new challenges and conquer them. <br>
Second, I am a person who is thirsty for knowledge. I can study anytime, anywhere, in any condition. <br>
And the last is I have a magic that can connect people. <br>
